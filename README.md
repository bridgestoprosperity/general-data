# General Data Analysis and Prep
A repository with notebooks and scripts for general data prep and analysis

# Getting Started
- After cloning this repo, create a folder named unsynced-data. This will be used when working with local data sets that are too large or that we do not want to sync to github. 
- If you want data to be synced to github (keep it under 100mb), put this in the synced-data directory.
- The notebooks folder contains various jupyter notebooks used for analysis.
